[Zeabur](https://zeabur.com) offers hosting for fullstack web applications. Any Astro site can be hosted on Zeabur as SSR or static site.

This guide includes instructions for deploying to Zeabur through the website UI.

## Project Configuration

Your Astro project can be deployed to Zeabur in two different ways: as a static site, or a server-rendered site.

### Static Site

Your Astro project is a static site by default. You donâ€™t need any extra configuration to deploy a static Astro site to Zeabur. 

### Server-Rendered Site

1. Add the following to your `astro.config.mjs` file:

    ```js
    import node from '@astrojs/node';
    
    export default defineConfig({
      output: 'server',
      adapter: node({
        mode: "standalone"
      })
    })
    ```

2. Modify the start command in your `package.json` file:

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node dist/server/entry.mjs"
      }
    }
    ```

## How to deploy

You can deploy to Zeabur through the website UI.

### Website UI Deployment

You can deploy your Astro site to Zeabur if the project is stored in GitHub.

1. Click <kbd>Create new project</kbd> in the [Zeabur dashboard](https://dash.zeabur.com)

2. Configure GitHub installation and import the repository.

3. Zeabur will automatically detect that your project is an Astro project and will build it using the `astro build` command.

4. Once the build is complete, you can bind a domain to your site and visit it.

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate new builds.
